Some random scripts I use on my computer to make life easier. Arter all, automating repetitive tasks is one of the most useful abilities of computers.

Summary of each:
Password ending generator - Given 2 letters, return the alphabet ordering of them. So "ac" returns 13. You can use this to make passwords with a predictable base, then add on the ending with this script, with a pattern like the last 2 letters of the site you are on. Ensures uniquness among passwords throughout sites.
